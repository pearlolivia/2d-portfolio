## How to use
Use the mouse to guide the player around the house to read fun facts about me! I have hidden personal and professional facts about myself inside the objects around the rooms.

## Planned improvements
Configure interaction for touch devices
Style update for text boxes

## Inspiration
I followed this tutorial by JSLegendDev: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_fSStEgMs 

## Assets
I created the map and the player animation using sprites from CupNooble's asset pack: https://cupnooble.itch.io/sprout-lands-asset-pack
